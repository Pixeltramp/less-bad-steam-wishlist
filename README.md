# less-bad-steam-wishlist

The new Steam wishlist page has some nice features, but wastes vertical screen real estate and pointlessly stops you from reordering your list when you have a filter active. 

Using a custom user style addon like [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/), it's simple to restore ordering while filtered and waste less vertical screen real estate with a few simple CSS rules. 

To use properly, filter on http://store.steampowered.com/wishlist and https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist

Hope this helps the new page annoy someone less!
